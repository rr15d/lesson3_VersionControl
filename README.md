## Project Description:
In this assignment, students are required to learn how Version Control and Github works and apply what they have learned through making changes to a site and using Git commands to commit their work, saving it to a repository.  In addition, the student must list and explain five concepts that they have learned about Version Control and Github in the site they have created.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Version Control is a system that is used to keep track of changes in files in a project over time.  If needed, the Version Control System is capable of pulling up a previous version of a project file.
2. Git is a special kind of Version Control System that takes snapshots of the project files to document changes over time rather than use a list of file-based changes, which most Version Control Systems often use.
3. It is important to note that files in Git exist in three different states: committed, modified, and staged.  Committed means the files have been safely stored in the database.  Modified means that the files have been modified but not stored.  Staged means that the files have been modified and currently designated to be put into the next commit snapshot.
